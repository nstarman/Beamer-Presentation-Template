# Templates

Repeating stuff sucks. Here are some templates to make it suck less.

Everything is a WIP that grows with use. I welcome suggestions, feature requests, and especially Pull Requests with improvements.


## Contents

### README

Basic Markdown and ReStructuredText ReadMe files.


### Figures

Doctrine:

- Figures should be organized and well-named
- The code used to make the figure should be included with the figure


### $\LaTeX$

Example latex file with article and presentation formats

Custom styles and large library of useful commands


### Python

Example `__init__`, normal, and script files.
