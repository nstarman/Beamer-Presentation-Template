# Figure Templates

Doctrine:
- Figures should be organized and well-named
- The code used to make the figure should be included with the figure

This document contains an example [figure file](./figure_1) with:

- an [image](./figure_1/example-image-a.jpg),
- a code [file](./figure_1/figure_1_code.py),
- a [README](./figure_1/README.md) describing the above.
